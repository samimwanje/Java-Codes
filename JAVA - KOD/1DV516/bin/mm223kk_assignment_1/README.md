The problems, are arranged Problem_1_X.

Each the soluions that belongs together are arranged using X.

1. Problem 1 can easily run by just runing the Problem_1.java file.

2. Problem 2 can easily run by runing the Problem_2.java file.

3. Problem 3 needs Problem_3_3.java, Function.java and problem_3_main.java in order to run. The main file is not necessary needed. It only demonstrates how the constructed timit class will be used.

4. Problem 4 locatedin Problem_4_main.java needs the Problem_3_Timeit.java in order to run.

* The results of Problem 4 are gathered in 3sum.csv and 3sum_si.csv *

* When the values from Problem_4_main.java are loaded into 3sum.csv and 3sum_si.csv after each run.*

* So make sure that these 2 files are cleared before runing Problem_4_main.java. Otherwise new lines of values will be generated.*

*  The results can be viewd in assignment_1_4.ipynb. *

5. Problem 5 needs Problem_5_UnionFind.java, in order to work. The Problem_5_main.java file can be used as an demonstration of the model.

6. Problem 5 needs Problem_6_quickUnion.java. A demonstration of problem 6 can be viewed in Problem_6_main.java.

7 Prolem 7 needs Problem_7_main.java, Problem_6_quickUnion.java and Problem_5_UnionFind.java in order to run. 

* Like problem 4 problem 6 generates values in unionFind100k and unionFind_q100k.csv after each run. *

* Make sure that these files are empty before a single run, or problem may occur in the assignment_1_7.ipynb file. *

8. Problem 8 needs Problem_8_Percolation.java in order to run. The demonstration of the program can be viewed in Problem_8_main.

* Notce that this program also generates values in csv files. The file percolation_10x10.csv is generated with values.  *

* percolation_nxn was pregenerated. The results can be viewed in assignment_1_8.ipynb. *

* Make sure that percolation_10x10.csv is empty before running Problem_8_main *
